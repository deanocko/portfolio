							Professional Practice within Intercultural and Global Contexts: Reflecting on an Internship Experience at Nutanix
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph-light mobile">
							Effective professional practice is paramount, particularly when faced with the nuanced dynamics of communication in a global context and when working within a multicultural team. This reflection, guided by Ullmann's model (2017), delves into one of my experiences at Nutanix when trying to deliver constructive feedback whilst creating a collaborative work environment with my colleagues. <br><br>

							In the fourth week of my internship, our group of eight interns was split into two groups, with our groups of four temporarily placed into a larger team of full-time employees to work together on real projects that Nutanix was tackling. Our team was instructed to develop a comprehensive plan for a town hall webinar that was to be hosted in the Sydney office and broadcast internationally to outline the progress made in the Asia Pacific region (APAC). My team had full-time employees from India, China and Australia, along with the other interns and myself who were from Ireland, Japan and Australia. With only two weeks to prepare, the need for rapid feedback and iterative development was evident. We were instructed to brainstorm our own ideas so as not to influence others before we would discuss and combine the most promising candidates into a cohesive plan. <br><br>

							The challenge emerged when my colleague from Japan began to present their suggestions, prompting another team member to offer critical feedback. The directness of this critique visibly unsettled my Japanese colleague, and I noticed them withdraw from the interaction. Witnessing this happen, I felt empathy and concern, recognising the importance of politeness and respect in Japanese culture and my colleague’s dejected attitude. Although I felt I should have intervened, I hesitated, unsure of how to navigate the situation and hoped it would be a one-off incident. Unfortunately, in a subsequent interaction, a similar communication dynamic began to unfold, and my colleague was repeatedly talked over when voicing their opinions. Regretting my inaction in the initial incident, I attempted to facilitate the conversation to allow room for both of my colleagues to voice their concerns in a constructive manner; however, I found it hard to convey my intentions without taking sides or causing offence to either party. Nonetheless, it was rewarding to have attempted to do what I thought was right in that context, especially as I had been paralysed into inaction during the initial occurrence. <br><br>


							Having travelled to over 30 countries and learnt a second language, I have developed a deep appreciation for foreign cultures and the differences they entail. I believe this enabled me to sympathise with both sides as I saw the conflict as the byproduct of two cultures with vastly differing norms as to how one should communicate respectfully rather than intentional malice. Livermore's (2015) work, and Engineers Australia's (2019) guidelines on professional conduct emphasise the necessity of developing intercultural competence, including sensitive feedback delivery. Reflecting on this episode, I recognised that this is an area that I would like to develop and that many of the managers at Nutanix were highly adept at phrasing their feedback in a constructive and respectful way while communicating their intended message. <br><br>

							I found this very impressive as the experience had been quite mentally draining, and I had been left questioning whether or not my handling of the situation was appropriate and what I should do differently in future. Despite this, the episode was immensely educational, stressing the value of cultural awareness, empathy, and the flexibility required to navigate global professional contexts. Beyond the specific incident, my internship experience at Nutanix served as a broader lesson in the complexities of intercultural teamwork. It affirmed the indispensable role of cultural sensitivity and effective communication in creating cohesive teams and driving collective success. As I move forward in my career, I am motivated to apply these insights to cultivate an environment of inclusivity and mutual respect in professional interactions. <br><br>

							In conclusion, my internship at Nutanix has been a pivotal moment in my professional development, offering a deep dive into the potential challenges and rewards of working within a global context. It has illuminated the path towards becoming a more culturally competent professional equipped to handle the complexities of a multicultural workforce. <br><br>
