							Professional Practice within Intercultural and Global Contexts: Reflecting on an Internship Experience at Nutanix
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph-light mobile">
							Effective professional practice is paramount, particularly when faced with the nuanced dynamics of communication in a global context and when working within a multicultural team. This reflection, guided by Ullmann's model (2017), delves into one of my experiences at Nutanix when trying to deliver constructive feedback whilst  creating a collaborative work environment with my colleagues.<br><br>

							In the fourth week of my internship we were instructed to develop a comprehensive plan for a town hall webinar to be hosted in the Sydney office and broadcast internationally. I was put into a team alongside colleagues from India, Ireland, Australia, China, and Japan. With only two weeks to prepare, the need for rapid feedback and iterative development was evident. Initially, we each formulated our own ideas before discussing them and opening the floor for feedback before combining our final ideas into a cohesive plan. The challenge emerged when a colleague from Japan presented their suggestions, prompting another team member to offer critical feedback. The directness of this critique visibly unsettled my Japanese colleague, highlighting a cultural rift in communication styles and the reception of feedback. Witnessing this interaction, I felt empathy and concern, recognizing the importance of politeness and respect in Japanese culture and my colleagues dejected attitude. 
							Although I felt compelled to intervene, I hesitated, unsure of how to navigate the situation and hoped that it was a one-off incident. Unfortunately, in a subsequent interaction a similar communication dynamic began to unfold. Regretting my inaction in the initial incident I attempted to facilitate the conversation to allow room for both of my colleagues to voice their opinions and concerns in a constructive manner, however, I found it hard to convey my intentions without taking sides or causing offence to either party. Nonetheless it was rewarding to have attempted to do what I thought was right in that context especially as I had been paralised into inaction during the initial occurrence. <br><br>				
														
							Having travelled to over 30 countries and learnt a second language I have developed a deep appreciation for foreign cultures which enabled me to understand that neither colleague intended disrespect; rather, they operated under different cultural norms regarding feedback. Livermore's (2015) work and Engineers Australia's (2019) guidelines on professional conduct emphasize the necessity of developing intercultural competence, including sensitive feedback delivery. Reflecting on this episode, I recognized that this is an area that I would like to develop and that many of the managers at Nutanix were highly adept in phrasing their feedback in a way that was constructive, respectful and able to be absorbed by the recipient without offense. <br><br>
							
							This was impressive to me as the experience had been quite mentally taxing for me and I had been left questioning my handling of the situation and what I would try to do differently in future. Despite this, the episode was immensely educational, stressing the value of cultural awareness, empathy, and the flexibility required to navigate global professional contexts. Beyond the specific incident, my internship experience at Nutanix served as a broader lesson in the complexities of intercultural teamwork. It affirmed the indispensable role of cultural sensitivity and effective communication in creating cohesive teams and driving collective success. As I move forward in my career, I am motivated to apply these insights, to cultivate an environment of inclusivity and respect in all professional interactions.<br><br>

							In conclusion, the internship at Nutanix has been a pivotal moment in my professional development, offering a deep dive into the challenges and rewards of working within a multicultural context. It has illuminated the path towards becoming a more culturally competent professional, equipped to handle the complexities of today’s globalized work environment. The lessons learned from this experience are invaluable, laying the foundation for a career marked by inclusivity, respect, and effective cross-cultural communication.<br><br>
