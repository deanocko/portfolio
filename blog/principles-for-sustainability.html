							Integrating Sustainability into Engineering: A Reflective Account from a Nutanix Internship
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph-light mobile">
							For the main group project during my internship, we were tasked with developing a dynamic dashboard
							that would primarily be used to help managers understand the needs of their team in real-time. The
							goal of the dashboard was for the manager to be able to ascertain, at a glance, all of the members of
							their team who may have needed assistance with a complex case and those best able to offer support.
							Second to this primary goal, the dashboard was to display other helpful metrics and reminders for
							tasks that needed to be completed at specific times. After hours, the dashboard should display staff
							achievements, birthdays and other news about Nutanix. We were informed that the dashboard would run
							continuously on all of the TVs in the office, and to accommodate this, we were set up with a virtual
							machine (VM) to host our designed solution. <br /><br />

							As our intern group started to flesh out the project requirements and build a framework for the
							dashboard, I became concerned about the energy consumption of having TVs operate 24/7, the constant
							use of power required by the over-provisioned VM we had been supplied and the likelihood that the LCD
							displays would burn out if they were not refreshed or powered off periodically. I proposed to one of
							the managers that we could set the dashboard and TVs to run on a schedule aligned with the work day,
							with a buffer window on either side for any employees who arrived early or left the office after
							hours. This would allow Nutanix to save money on its electricity costs, reduce its environmental
							footprint, and prolong the life of the TVs displaying the dashboard. I could only see upsides with my
							idea and was taken aback when the idea was brushed off, and we were told that difference would be
							negligible. I was discouraged that the idea wasn't properly considered and felt less motivated to work
							on the project as I felt we didn't have any agency over design elements or were able to make
							recommendations.<br /><br />

							One of the other interns who had liked the idea of scheduling the TVs suggested that we could also
							reduce the power consumption of the VM by only using the computational resources required for our
							project. They realised we could also create custom startup and shut-down scripts that would allow the
							VM to deactivate during the same time frame as the TVs, allowing for even greater energy savings. This
							would also give us an opportunity to prove to our mentors that we could apply the skills we had learnt
							during the internship to manage VMs using hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI). I was impressed that
							another intern had reflected and followed up with their own ideas to have a positive impact. Schön
							(1983) emphasises the importance of reflective practice in professional development, allowing for a
							critical analysis of our actions and their alignment with broader sustainability goals.<br /><br />

							Feeling emboldened by the solidarity of my colleague, we decided to present the idea to another
							manager who we thought might be more receptive. To our surprise, the manager was very supportive of
							the idea and agreed that our recommendation was a win-win for Nutanix, the environment and our own
							skill development. He also commended us on considering all of the consequences of our work, as they
							hadn't previously considered the pixel burn-in on the LCD displays, which would ultimately make the
							dashboards useless if they couldn’t operate. Ultimately, our dashboard was scheduled to power itself
							off for 10 hours a day, leading to energy savings of approximately 40% and potentially adding years of
							life to the TVs it was displayed on. <br /><br />

							Fien, Maclean, and Park (2009) argue for integrating sustainability into the engineering curriculum to
							ensure that future engineers are properly equipped to address the challenges of sustainable
							development. The challenge was not just identifying sustainability issues but finding feasible
							solutions within our project constraints that our superiors were willing to adopt. This critical
							engagement aligns with Boud, Keogh, and Walker’s (1985) view on reflective writing, encouraging a
							proactive stance towards diagnosing and solving problems.<br /><br />

							This experience during my internship reaffirmed that every project should have sustainability
							principles in mind, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Notably, it highlighted the role
							of engineers in contributing to a sustainable future. Moving forward, I aim to continue advocating for
							and implementing sustainable practices in all my endeavours. The lessons learned during my internship
							at Nutanix have solidified my resolve to prioritise sustainability as a priority and an integral part
							of my professional identity and practice.<br /><br />
