							Integrating Sustainability into Engineering: A Reflective Account from a Nutanix Internship
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph-light mobile">
							For the main group project during my internship we were tasked with developing a dynamic dashboard
							that would primarily be used to help managers keep tabs of their team to understand those who may be
							dealing with a complex case and need support, those able to offer said support and finally, to keep
							track of other tasks that needed to be completed prior to the end of shift. After hours, the dashboard
							should display staff achievements and birthdays continuously on all of the TVs in the office. To
							accommodate this we were set up with a virtual machine to host our program which controlled the
							dashboard.<br /><br />

							As our intern group started to flesh out the project requirements and build a framework for the
							dashboard I became concerned about the energy consumption of having TVs operate 24/7 and the overuse
							of computational resources in VM that had been provisioned for us. I proposed to the manager's that
							the TVs be automatically switched off prior to and after the work day instead of being left on
							indefinitely. The managers agreed to a three hour window either side of the main shifts which meant
							the TVs could be switched off for 10 hours a days and reduce their electricity consumption by about
							40%. After this suggestion another one of the interns suggested we apply what we had been learning
							about virtualisation and create a VM which only used the computational resources required for our
							project. We could also create custom startup and shut down procedures that would allow the VM to
							deactivate during the same time frame as the TVs allowing for even greater energy savings and an
							opportunity to showcase what we had learnt. This would save the company money on electricity and
							reduce the carbon footprint of the project.<br /><br />

							I was impressed that after my recommendation the other intern had reflected and followed up with their
							own ideas. Schön (1983) emphasizes the importance of reflective practice in professional development,
							allowing for a critical analysis of our actions and their alignment with broader sustainability goals.
							I was also pleasantly surprised by the willingness of the other interns and management to encourage
							the idea as it would ultimately benefit the company and showed that we were thinking deeply about the
							project and it's consequences.<br /><br />

							Fien, Maclean, and Park (2009), argue for the integration of sustainability into the engineering
							curriculum to ensure that future engineers are equipped to address the challenges of sustainable
							development. The challenge was not just identifying the sustainability issues but finding feasible
							solutions within our project constraints. This critical engagement is in line with Boud, Keogh, and
							Walker’s (1985) view on reflective writing, encouraging a proactive stance towards diagnosing and
							solving problems. Proposing the TVs turn off during inactive hours and optimizing the VM were my
							contributions towards a more sustainable project outcome.<br /><br />

							This experience during my internship made salient that every project should have sustainable
							principles in mind no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. The practical application of
							sustainability principles in an engineering project has highlighted the role of engineers in
							contributing to a sustainable future. Moving forward, I aim to continue advocating for and
							implementing sustainable practices in my engineering projects. The lessons learned during my
							internship at Nutanix have solidified my resolve to prioritise sustainability, ensuring that it
							becomes an integral part of my professional identity and practice.<br /><br />
