							<!-- Project Overview -->
							<article class="project-bubble overview">
								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Project Overview</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									The Automated Aircraft Visual Inspection (AAVI) project represents a significant advancement
									in automated defect detection for aircraft maintenance. Using state-of-the-art YOLO-NAS (You
									Only Look Once - Neural Architecture Search) technology, this system achieves unprecedented
									accuracy in identifying various types of aircraft surface defects.<br /><br />

									This innovative solution addresses the critical need for efficient and reliable aircraft
									inspection processes, potentially reducing inspection time while maintaining or improving
									accuracy.<br /><br />

									Our approach involved several key steps including dataset preparation with diverse aircraft
									surface defect images, implementation of YOLO-NAS architecture for defect detection, model
									training with optimized hyperparameters, extensive testing and validation on real-world
									scenarios, and thorough performance analysis and optimization.
								</p>
							</article>

							<article class="project-bubble methodology">
								<h1 class="body heading">Methodology</h1>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									The AAVI system combines hardware and software innovations to create a streamlined approach to
									aircraft defect inspection. Its design centers around two components:
									<br /><br />

									1. Data Acquisition Network (DAN) The DAN employs a hybrid solution of drones and stationary
									cameras to ensure thorough visual coverage of aircraft, even in challenging inspection areas.
									Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as DJI Matrice drones, scan the external and upper
									surfaces, while stationary cameras focus on intricate areas like undercarriages and landing
									gear. Images captured by the DAN are streamed in real-time for processing.
									<br /><br />

									2. Data Analysis and Sharing Hub (DASH) Captured image data is routed to DASH, which uses DCNN
									models for defect detection. The first model performs Defect Detection in Real-Time (DDRT),
									designed for speed and edge-device efficiency, such as GPU-enabled platforms. This is critical
									for providing actionable insights within the 20–40 minute window between flights. The second
									model, for Defect Detection Post-Hoc (DDPH), prioritizes high precision and recall, ensuring
									even subtle defects not flagged by the real-time system are identified before the aircraft
									Post-Hoc (DDPH), prioritizes high precision and recall, ensuring even subtle defects not
									flagged by the real-time system are identified before the aircraft resumes operations.
									<br /><br />

									The methodology is bolstered by image-labeling mechanisms, allowing models to retrain and
									adapt over time. Insights from failed inspections can propagate across systems worldwide,
									continually refining the process. This adaptive design makes the system resilient and
									future-proof, with potential applications in edge hardware scenarios, regulations adherence,
									and evolving model architectures.
								</p>

								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Dataset Creation and Composition</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									To facilitate the training and evaluation of the AAVI models, a comprehensive dataset was
									curated from six publicly available datasets, consisting of 4,492 images. After refinement,
									this dataset focused on three defect classes—cracks, dents, and missing fasteners. A key
									element of this work involved intensive cleaning, where duplicate images, augmented data, and
									unsuitable images (e.g., video-game captures and misannotated photos) were filtered out.
									<br /><br />

									Class distributions revealed imbalances—missing fasteners were the most common (1,720
									instances), while dents were underrepresented (915 instances). These limitations influenced
									model performance but were mitigated through carefully designed augmentations.
									<br /><br />

									To improve robustness against variability in real-world inspections, augmentations were
									applied, such as flipping, cropping, mosaics, and exposure adjustments. This expanded the
									dataset to over 5,800 training images, allowing the model to better generalize across diverse
									inspection scenarios.
									<br /><br />

									Finally, the dataset was split into 78% training, 15% validation, and 7% testing subsets.
									While slightly under the conventional 30% validation/testing split, this division maximized
									the model’s exposure to valuable training data while retaining enough test cases for reliable
									evaluations.
								</p>

							<!-- Results -->
							<article class="project-bubble results">
								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Results</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									The evaluation focused on both model performance and practical feasibility in real-time
									environments. The YOLO-NAS-L model was fine-tuned on the dataset and compared against
									competing architectures in the YOLO family (YOLOv5-L, YOLOv8-L, YOLOv9-e).
									<br /><br />

									The fine-tuned YOLO-NAS-L model demonstrated strong results, achieving an mAP@50 of 84.67%. A
									confidence threshold of 47% optimized its F2-score at 82.09%, with precision at 83.82% and
									recall at 81.67%. Importantly, the system outperformed human inspectors, achieving a
									comparable rate of false negatives (33%) while significantly reducing inspection times.
									<br /><br />

									Latency tests demonstrated the model’s viability for real-time deployment. On an NVIDIA T4
									GPU, inference latency was just 10.15 ms (equivalent to 98.52 frames per second) using FP16
									quantization. The model performed well across all tested platforms, including TensorRT-based
									hardware.
									<br /><br />

									<strong>Class-Specific Insights:</strong> <br />
									• Dents: High detection accuracy (~92%) and the lowest false negative rate (21%). <br />
									• Cracks: Lowest performance due to class imbalances and dataset variability; 47% false
									negatives. <br />
									• Missing Fasteners: Intermediate performance with 32% false negatives. <br />
									<br />
									Limitations remain in scenarios with non-standard lighting, weather conditions, and rare
									defect types. Addressing these will improve generalizability and reliability.

								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									<strong>1. Dataset Refinement:</strong> Increasing diversity in images by incorporating
									weather conditions, angles, and lighting scenarios. Labeling defect severity can add practical
									value for prioritizing maintenance actions. <br /><br />

									<strong>2. Model Innovation:</strong> Expanding the DDPH component with advanced NAS
									techniques, such as the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA), tailored for high-recall,
									high-precision tasks. <br /><br />

									<strong>3. Hardware Optimization:</strong> Validating DDRT for deployment on compact platforms
									like NVIDIA Jetson Xavier, ensuring real-time, edge-based inspections using industry-standard
									drones.
