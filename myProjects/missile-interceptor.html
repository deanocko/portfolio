								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Project Overview</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									In this assignment from the subject Programming for Mechatronic Systems, we were tasked with
									intercepting the maximum amount of 'bogies' within a 3 minute time frame. To be awarded marks
									for basic functionality, our program had to intercept the bogies when they were randomly
									generated within the flight area but were held stationary. Advanced functionality was awarded
									for intercepting the bogies when they were moving at different velocities. Bonus marks were
									awarded for the top 3 students in the subject that intercepted the most bogies within the 3
									minutes time frame and was to be tested by the tutors in a fair testing environment.
									<br /><br />

									We were only able to control the linear and angular velocity of our 'aircraft' and these were
									zero-sum in that, to achieve maximal linear or angular velocity we would have to sacrifice the
									other. To locate the bogies we were limited to the bearing and range of each bogy relative to
									our aircraft and the location of our aircraft relative to a static base station which was
									centered in the middle of the flight area.
									<br /><br />

									First, I broke the assignment down into parts. Using the available variables I designed a
									flight controller that allowed my aircraft to spend as much time as possible at maximum
									velocity. This meant that the aircraft would make turns as quickly as possible to then
									accelerate to maximum linear velocity. Whilst at maximum velocity, only gradual turns were
									allowed which maintained the aircraft at max velocity. To pursue an aircraft, the flight
									controller simply attempted to minimise the bearing between the aircraft and the bogy.
									<br /><br />

									Secondly, I used the measurements provided to me to determine the absolute location of the
									bogies and my aircraft. Following this, I created a function which calculated the time to
									intercept each bogy which factored in both the distance and time required to make the turn to
									a certain position in the flight space.
									<br /><br />

									Thirdly, I used a struct to encapsulate all of the relevant data about bogies into a single
									variable and pushed them into a queue. I then sorted the queue to order the bogies in terms of
									minimum time of interception. Using multithreading, this would be continually calculated
									multiple times per second.
									<br /><br />

									With all of this complete, my program already achieved both basic and advanced functionality
									without any changes required in configuration, however, I wanted to improve on my system. As
									the bogies flew on straight paths and at constant, although unknown, velocity, my idea was to
									store the previous bogie positions and time intervals to calculate the future position of the
									bogie. This would allow my flight controller to predict the interception point and straighten
									the flight path of my aircraft to minimise interception time. Ultimately, this proved far more
									difficult than I realised and I spent many days squashing bugs before I was finally able to
									get it working.
									<br /><br />

									The results, however, paid off and the implementation was much more efficient than a standard
									implementation. After getting my results back, I was in the top three students in terms of
									interceptions and received bonus marks, however, we weren't told which students achieved the
									best results.
									<br /><br />

									The actual bogy locations are shown in the video using the green marker. My implementation
									displays the blue markers as the the point at which my aircraft could intercept each
									respective bogy. Due to predicting the interception point, my flight controller could
									straighten the flight paths of my aircraft which meant it could intercept more bogies in a
									given timeframe than a standard implementation. I was in the top three students in terms of
									interceptions and received bonus marks.
									<br /><br />
								</p>
								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Potential Improvements</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									To further improve my design I could have implemented a graph search to decide the shortest
									route to pursue all bogies within the frame.
