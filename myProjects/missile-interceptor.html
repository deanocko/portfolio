								<h2 class="body subheading mobile">Project Overview</h2>
								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									In this assignment from the subject Programming for Mechatronic Systems, we were tasked with
									intercepting the maximum amount of 'bogies' within a 3 minute time frame. To be awarded marks
									for basic functionality, our program had to intercept the bogies when they were randomly
									generated within the flight area but were held stationary. Advanced functionality was awarded
									for intercepting the bogies when they were moving at different, unknown velocities. Bonus
									marks were awarded for the top 3 students in the subject whose implementation intercepted the
									most bogies in a fair testing environment.
									<br /><br />

									We were only able to control the linear and angular velocity of our 'aircraft' and these were
									zero-sum in that, to achieve maximal linear or angular velocity we would have to sacrifice the
									other. To locate the bogies we were limited to the bearing and range of each bogy relative to
									our aircraft and the location of our aircraft relative to a static base station which was
									centered in the middle of the flight area.
									<br /><br />

									First, I broke the assignment down into parts. Using the available variables I designed a
									flight controller that allowed my aircraft to spend as much time as possible at maximum linear
									velocity by turning as fast as possible until the bearing of the friendly aircraft was within
									15 degrees of the bogy. To pursue a bogy, the flight controller simply attempted to minimise
									the bearing between the aircraft and the bogy.
									<br /><br />

									Secondly, I used the measurements provided to me to determine the absolute location of the
									bogies and my aircraft. Following this, I created a function which calculated the time to
									intercept each bogy which factored in both the distance and time required to make the turn to
									a certain position in the flight space.
									<br /><br />

									Thirdly, I used a struct to encapsulate all of the relevant data about bogies into a single
									variable and pushed them into a vector. I then sorted the vector to order the bogies in terms
									of minimum time of interception. Using multithreading, this would be continually calculated
									multiple times per second.
									<br /><br />

								<p class="paragraph-light mobile">
									With all of this complete, my program already achieved both basic and advanced functionality
									without any changes required in configuration, however, I wanted to improve on my system. As
									the bogies flew on straight paths and at constant, although unknown, velocity, my idea was to
									store the previous bogie positions and time intervals to calculate the future position of the
									bogie. This would allow my flight controller to predict the interception point and straighten
									the flight path of my aircraft to minimise interception time. Ultimately, this proved far more
									difficult than I realised and I spent many days squashing bugs before I was finally able to
									get it working.

									To further improve my design I could have implemented a graph search to decide the shortest
